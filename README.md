# Focus Timer App

## Overview

Focus Timer is a simple and effective productivity app designed to help you stay focused on specific tasks. It allows you to set a timer, track progress, and get notified when your focus session ends.

### Key Features:

- **Input Task:** Enter what you want to focus on.
- **Custom Timer:** Choose a focus duration (10, 15, or 20 minutes).
- **Progress Tracker:** Visualize your progress with a status bar.
- **Notifications:** Receive a phone vibration alert when the timer ends.
- **Task Status:** Completed tasks are displayed in green text.

This was my first React Native project, created as part of a training program.
